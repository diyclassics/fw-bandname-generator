             At Island Bridge she met her tide.
              Attabom, attabom, attabombomboom! 
              The Fin had a flux and his Ebba a ride. 
              Attabom, attabom, attabombomboom! 
              We're all up to the years in hues and cribies. 
                  	Woe!
 
            Nomad may roam with Nabuch but let naaman laugh at Jor- 
dan! For we, we have taken our sheet upon her stones where we
have hanged our hearts in her trees; and we list, as she bibs us,
by the waters of babalong.
