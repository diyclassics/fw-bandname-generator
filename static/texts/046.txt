Small wonder He'll Cheat E'erawan our local lads nicknamed him
When Chimpden first took the floor
      (Chorus) With his bucketshop store 

                  
          Down Bargainweg, Lower. 

So snug he was in his hotel premises sumptuous
But soon we'll bonfire all his trash, tricks and trumpery
And'tis short till sheriff Clancy'll be winding up his unlimited

                  
                  
                  
                  
               
  [company 
With the bailiff's bom at the door,
      (Chorus) Bimbam at the door. 

                  
Then he'll bum no more. 

Sweet bad luck on the waves washed to our island
The hooker of that hammerfast viking
And Gall's curse on the day when Eblana bay
Saw his black and tan man-o'-war.
      (Chorus) Saw his man-o'-war. 
             
                  
On the harbour bar.

Fingal Mac Oscar Onesine Bargearse Boniface
Thok's min gammelhole Norveegickers moniker
Og as ay are at gammelhore Norveegickers cod.
      (Chorus) A Norwegian camel old cod. 
 
                  
      He is, begod. 

Lift it, Hosty, lift it, ye devil ye! up with the rann, the rhyming
                                                 
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
[rann! 
It was during some fresh water garden pumping
Or, according to the Nursing Mirror, while admiring the mon-

                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                                       [keys 
That our heavyweight heathen Humpharey
Made bold a maid to woo
      (Chorus) Woohoo, what'll she doo! 
       
                  
      The general lost her maidenloo!
