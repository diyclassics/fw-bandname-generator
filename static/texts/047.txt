He ought to blush for himself, the old hayheaded philosopher,
For to go and shove himself that way on top of her.
Begob, he's the crux of the catalogue
Of our antediluvial zoo,
      (Chorus) Messrs. Billing and Coo. 
             Noah's larks, good as noo. 

He was joulting by Wellinton's monument
Our rotorious hippopopotamuns
When some bugger let down the backtrap of the omnibus
And he caught his death of fusiliers,
      (Chorus) With his rent in his rears. 
             Give him six years. 

'Tis sore pity for his innocent poor children
But look out for his missus legitimate!
When that frew gets a grip of old Earwicker
Won't there be earwigs on the green?
      (Chorus) Big earwigs on the green, 
             The largest ever you seen. 

Suffoclose! Shikespower! Seudodanto! Anonymoses!

Then we'll have a free trade Gaels' band and mass meeting
For to sod the brave son of Scandiknavery.
And we'll bury him down in Oxmanstown
Along with the devil and Danes,
      (Chorus) With the deaf and dumb Danes, 
             And all their remains. 

And not all the king's men nor his horses
Will resurrect his corpus
For there's no true spell in Connacht or hell
      (bis) That's able to raise a Cain.
